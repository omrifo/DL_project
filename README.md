ImageColor: A Deep Learning Project for Image Coloring

Overview

ImageColor is a deep learning project designed to automate the process of image coloring. Utilizing advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this project transforms grayscale images into vibrant, colorized versions. The model is trained on a large dataset of color images, learning to predict and apply realistic colors to monochrome images.
